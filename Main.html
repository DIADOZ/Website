Early on getting a lot of hometown exposure by teaming up with the online music club <span style="font-weight: bold">THE GOOD GRIND</span> coordinating freestyles and indi project drops to get some exposure. During the last couple of year Tylon has taken the time to reinvent himself. Giving more attention to creating music that shows a more personal side of himself. He hopes to keep his integrity on his journey. It is not everyday that a West Virginia artist makes it out. The rest of Universe watches with a grain of hope.</div>-->

You got the sense that the silk jacquard 18th-century dresses were every bit as weightless as the parachute-fabric flight suits. There was relatively little embellishment on those dresses; the sumptuous, shimmery materials and the voluptuous forms were the story. His flapperish dresses, meanwhile, were dripping not in heavy beads but in high-tech resin fringe.</div>-->
